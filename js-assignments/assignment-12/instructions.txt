* Don't use inline styles, only use classes
* Use let if the variable changes, Use const if the variable won't change, Don't use var.
* Save constants on the top of the javascript file(Ex: Regular expressions, DOMElement variables)
* An id attribute should be unique and should be given to single element in the entire HTML
