Objective: 
* Develop an Car Fleet app by considering below use cases
* Follow the below standards during development

Use cases:

* User should be able to add car dynamically 
* User should be able to start or stop a specific car
* User should be able to accelerate or decelerate a specific car

Follow the below standards:

* All javascript function names and variable names should be in camel case (Ex: firstName)
* All ids should be camel case
* All CSS class names should be hyphenated(Ex: form-input)
* Keep meaningful names (Ex: Don't use a,b,c,ab,bc,x,y,z...etc)
* Do less DOM operations as they impact performance
* Don't use inline styles, only use classes
* Use let if the variable changes, Use const if the variable won't change, Don't use var.
* Save constants on the top of the javascript file(Ex: Regular expressions, DOMElement variables)
* An id attribute should be unique and should be given to single element in the entire HTML
