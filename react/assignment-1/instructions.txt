* Follow the below standards during development

Problem Statement 1:

* Refer preview-1

Problem Statement 2:

* Create the below react components
    * StandardImageView
    * RoundedCornersImageView
    * CircularImageView

Follow the below standards:

* All function names and variable names should be in camel case (Ex: firstName)
* All ids should be camel case
* All CSS class names should be hyphenated(Ex: form-input)
* Keep meaningful names (Ex: Don't use a,b,c,ab,bc,x,y,z...etc)
* Do less DOM operations as they impact performance
* CSS classes are generally better for performance than inline styles.
* Use let if the variable changes, Use const if the variable won't change, Don't use var
* Save constants on the top of the javascript file(Ex: Regular expressions)
* An id attribute should be unique and should be given to single element in the entire HTML
